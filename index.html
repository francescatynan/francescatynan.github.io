      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my page, I'm Francesca, an aspiring tech professional and current customer service innovator with awards for performance, strong 
        mentoring experience and experience managing commercial scale projects in Google Sheets.</p>
      <p>I'm a Cajigo 100 Women in Tech 2024 Mentee, and a Code First Girls alumna from their intensive 16 week 'CFGDegree' Software/Data Engineering 
        bootcamp, 4 week '+Masters' Cyber Security extension and 8 week Vulnerability Research specialisation, all thanks to education-only sponsorship 
        by GCGQ for kindly making this opportunity possible.</p>

      <h1>Technical Awareness</h1>
      <p>With my studies delving into security principles and vulnerabilities, secure coding practices are at the forefront of my approach. My 
        approach to coding is led by concepts like AAA, the CIA triad, the importance of HTTPS, input validation and broadly speaking security 
        by design to mitigate threats and protect against common vulnerabilities. Considerations of access control, salting and hashing, and the 
        principle of least priviledge (PoLP) are just some of the many concepts I'm versed in.</p>
      <p>I have covered a broad range of learning beyond simply languages. Comfortable with MySQL, Python with Flask, HTML, CSS and Javascript, 
        I've also written unittests, utilised test-driven development (TDD), Git, Github, Jira, Trello, pair programming, code reviews and written 
        assessed reports from the perspective of a security analyst, and a vulnerability researcher.</p>
      <p>I continue to expand my learning proactively and look eagerly to a long future in this industry.</p>

      <h1>CFGDegree Group Project</h1>
      <p>As a group of six, we finished our Code First Girls CFGDegree Summer 2024 in Software/Data Engineering by collaborating to create 
        a customisable password generator and password manager within a month utilising MySQL, Python, Flask, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I acted as 
        project manager and we made use of Jira, GitHub Branches, Trello and code reviews. See our results below. We made use of hashing and salting 
        amongst other security precautions to protect the data of our web app's users.</p>
